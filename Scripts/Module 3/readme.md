#Module 3

This folder contains a script for Rhino's Grasshopper visual programming environment that allows users to convert wave attenuation data into geometry for further visualization and evaluation. This script is located in Module 3 of the Scripts folder under 'GTides-Bake.gh'.

All processing in this module was done with vanilla Grasshopper and Python. In the event that the Python scripts do not automatically import into their custom components properly, they are included in the 'Python-Scripts' subfolder.

The contents of script 'subsampling_factors.py' should be pasted into the 'subsampling factors' component in group 5 of 'GTides-Bake.gh'. Likewise, the contents of 'calculate_subsample_percent.py' should be pasted into the 'calculate subsample percent' component of the same group.
